# My Bitcoin Cash Library

This code is neither safe, tested nor intended for production use and it's not even in alpha state.

**Do NOT use this code!**

## History

Existing Bitcoin JavaScript libraries are quite large and involve learning the library quirks/api on top of learning bitcoin itself.  I began writing this library as a learning exercise, going back (as much as I can) to basics.  Obviously, for developing production apps you should use libraries that are safe, tested and have many eyes watching for problems (ie popular ones).

## Objectives

* Avoid use of external libraries where practical to learn more about the Bitcoin protocol.
* Use Flow static type checking to both learn it and see what it's like in a non-trivial project.
